# Investigating Netflix Movies

We never forget our first experiences. The first day in a new school, the first love, the first visit to another country... Well, I will certainly always remember this project, which was the first that I did in Python. Not only was I super excited to apply my newly gained skills, but I was also genuinely interested in the topic. Win-win! As someone who has worked in the media space (I started my career in TV) and did a bit of amateur acting, I have an intrinsic eagerness to explore this industry. Though I certainly didn't work with any Hollywood celebrities back in my 'glorious days', the questions I was able to answer through this project felt like something I would naturally like to find out. OK, enough about my motivation. Let's move on to the project itself.

## The main questions the project revolves around:

-   Has Netflix movie duration decreased over time?
-   If so, what could be the possible reason?
-   How does genre diversity affect movie duration?

It turned out that lately, Netflix has released significantly more documentaries, stand-ups, and children movies, which all tend to be shorter. Therefore, this could likely affect the movie duration when looking at the whole dataset. But, this was just a quick **exploratory data analysis**, and one should explore further before concluding that is the case. At the very least, the findings from this project provided a solid base for further analysis, looking to collect additional data and, of course, asking more related questions.

This project is available on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)'s platform and requires an **Intermediate Python** level. Even though I had completed only a few introductory and intermediate courses on data science in Python before I worked on this project, I could still utilise quite a few interesting skills and approaches. 

## Some of the things I did in the project:

-   Created a dictionary from lists.
-   Created a dataframe from a dictionary.
-   Read a .csv file into a dataframe.
-   Selected columns using both square brackets and the dot notation.
-   Visualised data through line plots and scatter plots with **Matplotlib**.
-   Filtered rows using logic operators.
-   Subseted columns.
-   Used a <code>for</code> loop.
-   Used the <code>.append()</code>method.
-   Applied a list of colours to a scatter plot to differentiate between several categories.
